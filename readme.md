# AuthenticTantrumNoises

This is a light-weight mod for Rimworld that will emit sounds
from pawns during certain mental break conditions. In other words
it'll make them swear and scream instead of silently rage.

## Steam Workshop version

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2839608123

The version on Steam Workshop contains a set of sound files not
included in this repository.

## Adding your own sound files

Put your sound files in Sounds/Pawn/Animal/Human in .ogg format,
then add them to Defs/SoundDefs/Pawn_Tantrum.xml

Every file needs its own entry, clipPath ends in the file name,
minus the extension. So the file

````
Human_Tantrum6
````

is actually called

````
Human_Tantrum6.ogg
````

in the file system.
